# PCTP.PGx-CDS
Pharmacogenomics clinical decision support (PGx-CDS) is an important tool to incorporate PGx information into existing clinical workflows and facilitate PGx clinical translation. Pharmacogenomics Clinical Translation Platform (PCTP) is developed for the clinical implementation of PGx in routine care practice. The PCTP can represent, store and manage the primary PGx knowledge in a structured and computable format, the PCTP can be used as a PGx ancillary system to provide various PGx-CDS services and simplify the work of integrating PGx into electronic health records.
